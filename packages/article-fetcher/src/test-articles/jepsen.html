      <h1 class="title">Serializability</h1>

      <div class="content"><div class="section group" markdown="1">
<div class="col span_12_of_12">
<p>Informally, serializability means that transactions appear to have occurred in
some total order.</p>
<p>Serializability is a <em>transactional</em> model: operations (usually termed
“transactions”) can involve several primitive sub-operations performed in
order. Serializability guarantees that operations take place
<em>atomically</em>: a transaction’s sub-operations do not appear to interleave with
sub-operations from other transactions.</p>
<p>It is also a <em>multi-object</em> property: operations can act on multiple objects in
the system. Indeed, serializability applies not only to the <em>particular</em>
objects involved in a transaction, but to <em>the system as a whole</em>—operations
may act on predicates, like “the set of all cats”.</p>
<p>Serializability cannot be totally or sticky available; in the event of a
network partition, some or all nodes will be unable to make progress.</p>
<p>Serializability implies <a href="repeatable-read">repeatable read</a>, <a href="snapshot-isolation">snapshot isolation</a>, etc. However, it does not impose any real-time, or even per-process constraints. If process A completes write <em>w</em>, then process B begins a read <em>r</em>, <em>r</em> is not necessarily guaranteed to observe <em>w</em>. For those kinds of real-time guarantees, see <a href="strict-serializable">strict serializable</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, serializability does not require a per-process order between
transactions. A process can observe a write, then <em>fail</em> to observe that same
write in a subsequent transaction. In fact, a process can fail to observe its
own prior writes, if those writes occurred in different transactions.</p>
<p>The requirement for a total order of transactions is strong—but still allows
pathological orderings. For instance, a serializable database can always return
the empty state for any reads, by appearing to execute those reads at time 0.
It can also discard write-only transactions by reordering them to execute at
the very <em>end</em> of the history, after any reads. Operations like increments can
also be discarded, assuming the result of the increment is never observed.
Luckily, most implementations don’t seem to take advantage of these
optimization opportunities.</p>
<h2><a href="#formally" id="formally">Formally</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~len/sql1999.pdf">ANSI SQL 1999 spec</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execution of concurrent SQL-transactions at isolation level SERIALIZABLE
is guaranteed to be serializable. A serializable execution is defined to be
an execution of the operations of concurrently executing SQL-transactions
that produces the same effect as some serial execution of those same
SQL-transactions. A serial execution is one in which each SQL-transaction
executes to completion before the next SQL-transaction begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and goes on to define its isolation levels in terms of proscribed
anomalies: serializable is <a href="read-committed">read committed</a>, but without phenomenon P3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P3 (“Phantom”): SQL-transaction T1 reads the set of rows N that satisfy some
&lt;search condition&gt;. SQL-transaction T2 then executes SQL-statements that
generate one or more rows that satisfy the &lt;search condition&gt; used by
SQL-transaction T1. If SQL-transaction T1 then repeats the initial read with
the same &lt;search condition&gt;, it obtains a different collection of rows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-95-51.pdf">Berenson, Bernstein, et al
observed</a>,
the ANSI specification allows multiple intepretations, and one of those
interpretations (the “anomaly interpretation”) admits nonserializable histories.</p>
<p><a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/adya-phd.pdf">Adya’s formalization of transactional isolation
levels</a> provides a more thorough
summary of the preventative interpretation of the ANSI levels, defining
serializability as the absence of four phenomena. Serializability prohibits:</p>
<ul>
<li>P0 (Dirty Write): w<sub>1</sub>(x) … w<sub>2</sub>(x)</li>
<li>P1 (Dirty Read):  w<sub>1</sub>(x) … r<sub>2</sub>(x)</li>
<li>P2 (Fuzzy Read):  r<sub>1</sub>(x) … w<sub>2</sub>(x)</li>
<li>P3 (Phantom):     r<sub>1</sub>(P) … w<sub>2</sub>(y in P)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here <em>w</em> denotes a write, <em>r</em> denotes a read, and subscripts indicate the
transaction which executed that operation. The notation “…” indicates a
series of micro-operations <em>except</em> for a commit or abort. P indicates a
predicate.</p>
<p>As Adya notes, the preventative interpretation of the ANSI specification is
<em>overly restrictive</em>: it rules out some histories which are legally
serializable.</p>
<p>For a reasonably intuitive formalization based on abstract executions, see
Cerone, Bernardi, &amp; Gotsman’s <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5375/pdf/15.pdf">A Framework for Transactional Consistency Models
with Atomic
Visibility</a>,
which specifies serializability as a combination of three properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal consistency: within a transaction, reads observe that transaction’s
most recent writes (if any)</li>
<li>External consistency: reads <em>without</em> a preceding write in transaction T<sub>1</sub>
must observe the state written by a transaction T<sub>0</sub>, such that T<sub>0</sub> is
visible to T<sub>1</sub>, and no more recent transaction wrote to that object.</li>
<li>Total visibility: the visibility relationship must be a <em>total</em> order.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a state-based formalization, see Crooks, Pu, Alvisi, &amp; Clement: <a href="https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/apps/sites/default/files/tech_reports/paper_extendedtr.pdf">Seeing is Believing: A Client-Centric Specification of Database Isolation</a>.</p>
